# RegularGameOnGlitch

Welcome to RegularGameOnGlitch! This project is my first attempt at creating a game, and I'm excited to share my progress with you. Since I was a youngin I've wanted to create a video game and for decades I attempted 
at different intervals with different languages and ideas but never made it far. This is actually a working 'video game' in the strictest sense of the words. It needs a lot of work on a lot of stuff I'll try to keep the issue
tracker up to date. Any suggestions or comments are mostly welcome.
